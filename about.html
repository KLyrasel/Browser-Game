        <p> Thomas Frogerton is a seemingly successful businessman, or so he thinks. Little does he know that despite his own thoughts on his lifestyle, all of the people around him think he's a bully. He yells at his assitant for not getting his ridiculous coffee order right, he doesn't take his coworkers seriously, he's very hard to work with, and entitled in his day to day life. When he goes to the store, he parks in the handicapped parking spots just because it's more convenient for him, he talks very loudly and crudely on the phone when in public, and will make a scene to get what he wants at the expense of others. One day, as he's walking to work he hurries past a mysterious man huddled on the sidewalk, shoving him out of the way with his shoulder and not even bothering to apologize. The man stares after him in a disconcerting way, waving a finger in his direction and shouting something unintelligible. He only barely catches the end of his sentence, " you'll get what you deserve Mr.Frog! ". A bit shaken by the interaction, Thomas brushes it off as some weirdo that must've caught his name a different day - he does know a lot of people and hardly bothers remembering faces. He'd heard the frog thing a million times anyways, so it didn't bother him very much anymore. It was just a very stupid thing to say, he thinks, and by the end of the day he'd forgotten all about it. He falls asleep peacefully and ignorant of the stresses he'd caused everyone else, blissfully unaware that his assitant had cried in their car on their lunchbreak, that his boss was sifting through written complaints about him, that his date had been humiliated by his behavior at dinner that night and had faked an emergency to step out, and most importantly that he'd finalized a vengeful wizards choices when he'd shoved him earlier that day. When the alarm goes off to wake him up the next morning, his life will never be the same...</p>
